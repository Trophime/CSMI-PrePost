This repository contains the source of CSMI Pre and PostProcessing course.
It includes:

- [x] documentation using asciidoc and antora
- [ ] {feelpp} applications in {cpp} to use {feelpp} and {feelpp} toolboxes in `src`
- [ ] python {feelpp} notebooks that can be downloaded from the documentation
- [ ] continuous integration including tests for the {cpp} applications
- [x] docker image generation for the course

The documentation for csmi-prepost is available at link:https://trophime.github.io/CSMI-PrePost/course-project-dash/[here] and you can build on it for your project by enabling the link:https://docs.github.com/en/pages[github pages] for your repository.

== Setting up CI/CD

 - create an empty .nojekyll in gh-pages
 - in repository settings, add secrets attached to the repository

== Developing docs

 - open the project in `vscode`,
 - stats the devcontainer,
 - run `./antora-preview.sh`,
 - start Vscode Liveserver extension, this will open firefox with the website (on port 5500 in the container),
 - To active livereload functionnality, you need to install link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/live-reload/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search[livereload extension] in firefox
 - Create a reload rule, for instance:

NOTE: Vscode LiveReload extension is not working. It has therefore been disabled in the devcontainer.

NOTE: On the host, you can also use `firefox --private-window http://localhost:5500/' to view the web devsite.

TIP: you may need to change the port. Check open ports on host with nmap.

 
== Updating the {project} version

The version of the project is defined in the files `CMakeLists.txt`, `docs/antora.yml` and `docs/package.json`. 
You need to update with the same version in all files.

== Release process

- [x] update the version in CMakeLists.txt
- [x] update the version in docs/antora.yml
- [x] commit the changes with the message "Release vx.y.z". At this point the CI will generate the docker image and push it to docker hub
