= PreProcessing

Covers:
* Creating/Loading a solid model of the geometry,
* Generating a mesh

add diagram for the classical pipeline, use kroki/mermaid 

[note]
====
These operations may be difficult and time-consuming (up to several months to get a descent mesh).
Moreover, CAD and meshing may also require a lot of CPU time and memory ressources.
====

The pipeline, eventually, need to be updated from the calculation if the problem is transient and/or the geometry is deformed.
